# PGPemuKeyFormatter
This tool is used to format the data provided by the "Suota Go+" app from Jesus Bamford (https://github.com/Jesus805/Suota-Go-Plus)
to fit the needs of the PGPemu Project for the ESP32 from Yohanes Nugroho (https://github.com/yohanes/pgpemu). 
To Download the SuotaGo+ App: https://github.com/Jesus805/Suota-Go-Plus/releases/tag/v1.0

## How to use
Copy the Mac, blob and device key from the json file into the separte files(rawmac.txt; rawblob.txt; rawkey.txt) for each one (without the brackets "{}").
Then just run PGPemuKeyFormatter.exe.
The formatted data could be found in the three new files (mac.txt; bloob.txt; key.txt).

### To build the project on your own
